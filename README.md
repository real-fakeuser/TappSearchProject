chayns速 with ES.NEXT - Template
===================
This template contains a tapp using the chayns API.
If you're a chayns速 manager you can switch to the specific mode and a PersonFinder will get visible.  
Using this PersonFinder you can select users which then will be appended to the user list.

This template will help you getting started with building Tapps for your chayns速-Website with ES.Next. First of all you have to make sure, that you have the latest version of [node.js][1] installed.

Development
-------------
1. Install all project dependencies with  `npm i`
2. Start your webpack-dev-server for debugging your project with `npm start`
    > The webpack-dev-server is now running on your localhost on the port 8080. If the port is not available you can change it in the dev.babel.js in the webpack folder. 

    > `npm start` runs the server in HTTPS mode. If you just need HTTP then you can use `npm run start:http`

3. Implement the example Tapp to your chayns速 site .
    1. Go to Administration -> Configuration -> Content -> Tapps
    2. Click `Add Tapp`
    3. Use external content
    4. Give the Tapp a name and type in the following URL : `https://localhost:8080`
    5. Click `add`
4. Start development.

Building
---------
You can build this project via `npm run build` for a Live version.

You can also build this project with sourceMaps for testing via `npm run build:staging`.
